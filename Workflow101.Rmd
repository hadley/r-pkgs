# Fundamental development workflows {#workflows101}

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

Having peeked under the hood of R packages and libraries in Chapter \@ref(package-structure-state), here
we provide the basic workflows for creating a package and moving it through the different states that come up during development.

## Survey the existing landscape

<!-- TODO: would love to put some version of the "geeks and repetitive tasks" figure here, but it would take more time than I want to spend right now to figure out original source, licensing, etc. Revisit when I do a concentrated push on figures. -->

Many packages are born out of one person's frustration at some common task that should be easier. How should you decide whether something is package-worthy? There's no definitive answer, but it's helpful to appreciate at least two types of payoff:

  * Product: your life will be better when this functionality is implemented
    formally, in a package.
  * Process: greater mastery of R will make you more effective in your work.
  
If all you care about is the existence of a product, then your main goal is to navigate the space of existing packages. Silge, Nash, and Graves organized a survey and sessions around this at useR!2017 and their write up for the R Journal [silge-nash-graves] provides a comprehensive roundup of resources.

If you are looking for ways to increase your R mastery, you should still educate yourself about the landscape. But there are plenty of good reasons to make your own package, even if there is relevant prior work. The way experts got that way is by actually building things, often very basic things, and you deserve the same chance to learn by tinkering. If you're only allowed to work on things that have never been touched, you're likely looking at problems that are either very obscure or very difficult.

Finally, it's also valid to evaluate the suitability of existing tools on the basis of user interface, defaults, and edge case behaviour. If a package can technically do what you need, but it's very unergonomic for your use case, it's fair to say it doesn't meet your needs. In this case, it can still make sense for you to develop your own implementation or to write wrapper functions that hide the sharp edges.

## Naming your package {#naming}

Before you can create your first package, you need to come up with a name for it. I think this is the hardest part of creating a package! (Not least because devtools can't automate it for you.)

### Requirements for a name

There are three formal requirements: the name can only consist of letters, numbers and periods, i.e., `.`; it must start with a letter; and it cannot end with a period. Unfortunately, this means you can't use either hyphens or underscores, i.e., `-` or `_`, in your package name. I recommend against using periods in package names because it has confusing connotations (i.e., file extension or S3 method).

### Strategies for creating a name

If you're planning on releasing your package, I think it's worth spending a few minutes to come up with a good name. Here are some recommendations for how to go about it:

* Pick a unique name you can easily Google. This makes it easy for potential users to 
  find your package (and associated resources) and for you to see who's using it. 
  You can also check if a name is already used on CRAN by loading <http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/[PACKAGE_NAME]>.

* Avoid using both upper and lower case letters: doing so makes the package name
  hard to type and even harder to remember. For example, I can never remember if it's
  Rgtk2 or RGTK2 or RGtk2.

* Find a word that evokes the problem and modify it so that it's unique:

    * plyr is generalisation of the apply family, and evokes pliers.
    * lubridate makes dates and times easier.
    * knitr (knit + r) is "neater" than sweave (s + weave).
    * testdat tests that data has the correct format.

* Use abbreviations: 

    * Rcpp = R + C++ (plus plus)
    * lvplot = letter value plots. 

* Add an extra R: 

    * stringr provides string tools.
    * tourr implements grand tours (a visualisation method).
    * gistr lets you programmatically create and modify GitHub gists.

If you're creating a package that talks to a commercial service, make sure you check the branding guidelines to avoid problems down the line. For example, rDrop isn't called rDropbox because Dropbox prohibits any applications from using the full trademarked name.

### Checking if your package name is available

It is a good idea to spend some time choosing your package name.
You can check if your package name is available for use on CRAN 
by using the [`available` package](https://github.com
ropenscilabs/available), which does the following:

* Checks for validity
* Checks not already available on GitHub, CRAN and Bioconductor
* Searches Urban Dictionary, Wiktionary and Wikipedia for 
unintended meanings

(insert screenshot here?)

While checking if your package name is available, it might also 
be worthwhile to check if the functionality of your package 
already exists - you may save yourself a lot of time using 
existing software rather than writing your own.

For more discussion on other aspects of R package names, see [Nick Tierney's blog post on naming things](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2018/06/20/naming-things/). If you change your mind on your package name, Nick also has a blog post on [how to rename your package](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2017/10/27/change-pkg-name/).

## Creating a package {#getting-started}

Once you've come up with a name, there are two ways to create the package. You can use RStudio:

1. Click File | New Project.

2. Choose "New Directory":

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/create-1.png")
    ```
   
2. Then "R Package":

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/create-2.png")
    ```

2. Then give your package a name and click "Create Project":

    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/create-3.png")
    ```
    
Alternatively, you can create a new package from within R by running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::create_package("path/to/package/pkgname")
```
    
Either route gets you to the same place: the smallest usable package, one with three components:

1. An `R/` directory, which you'll learn about in [R code](#r).

1. A basic `DESCRIPTION` file, which you'll learn about in 
   [package metadata](#description).

1. A basic `NAMESPACE` file, which you'll learn about in 
   [the namespace](#namespace).

It will also include an RStudio project file, `pkgname.Rproj`, that makes your package easy to use with RStudio, as described below.

Don't use `package.skeleton()` to create a package. Following that workflow actually creates more work for you because it creates extra files that you'll have to delete or modify before you can have a working package.

## RStudio projects {#projects}

To get started with your new package in RStudio, double-click the `pkgname.Rproj` file that `create()` just made. This will open a new RStudio project for your package. Projects are a great way to develop packages because:

*   Each project is isolated; code run in one project does not affect any 
    other project.

*   You get handy code navigation tools like `F2` to jump to a function
    definition and `Ctrl + .` to look up functions by name.

*   You get useful keyboard shortcuts for common package development tasks.
    You'll learn about them throughout the book. But to see them all, press 
    Alt + Shift + K or use the Help | Keyboard shortcuts menu.
    
    ```{r, echo = FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/keyboard-shortcuts.png")
    ```
   
(If you want to learn more RStudio tips and tricks, follow @[rstudiotips](https://twitter.com/rstudiotips) on twitter.)

Both RStudio and `usethis::create_package()` will make an `.Rproj` file for you. If you have an existing package that doesn't have an `.Rproj` file, you can use `usethis::use_rstudio("path/to/package")` to add it. If you don't use RStudio, you can get many of the benefits by starting a new R session and ensuring the working directory is set to the package directory. 

### What is an RStudio project file?

An `.Rproj` file is just a text file. The project file created by devtools looks like this:

```
Version: 1.0

RestoreWorkspace: No
SaveWorkspace: No
AlwaysSaveHistory: Default

EnableCodeIndexing: Yes
Encoding: UTF-8

AutoAppendNewline: Yes
StripTrailingWhitespace: Yes

BuildType: Package
PackageUseDevtools: Yes
PackageInstallArgs: --no-multiarch --with-keep.source
PackageRoxygenize: rd,collate,namespace
```

You don't need to modify this file by hand. Instead, use the friendly project options dialog box, accessible from the projects menu in the top-right corner of RStudio.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/project-options-1.png")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/project-options-2.png")
```
    
*TODO: re-integrate this diagram*    
    
```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/loading.png")
```
