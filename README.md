This repo holds the code and text behind the **R Packages** book. The site is built with [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).

  * The first edition is available at <http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz>.
  * A second edition is under development and available at <https://r-pkgs.org>.

*Status as of 2019-02: Work on a second edition is starting and this repo is coming out of hibernation. Issues and PRs are welcome. There will be big updates subsequent to the [recent changes in devtools and related packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2018/10/devtools-2-0-0/). We may need to implement those changes systematically ourselves vs. piecemeal, so consider that when deciding between opening an issue or a PR.* 

## Notes on mechanics

Screenshots: use `include_graphics()`, chunk should have `output.width = NULL`.
